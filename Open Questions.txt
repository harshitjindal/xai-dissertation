Open questions:
1. Check class rebalancing after SMOTE. Maybe try looking at the support.
2. Check what each leaf node of the decision tree means
3. Why do we have (OBS = 0) in the decision tree visualization?
4. How to handle numeric scaling with visualization of decision tree?
5. Maybe try applying LIME and SHAP to inherently explainable models like LR
6. What type of problem statements can EBM used for?
7. LIME/SHAP on CNN/RNN/LSTM models?
