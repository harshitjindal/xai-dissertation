Open questions:
1. Check class rebalancing after SMOTE. Maybe try looking at the support.
2. Check what each leaf node of the decision tree means
3. Why do we have (OBS = 0) in the decision tree visualization?
4. How to handle numeric scaling with visualization of decision tree?
5. Maybe try applying LIME and SHAP to inherently explainable models like LR
